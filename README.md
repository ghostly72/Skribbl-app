# Skribbl-app
A simple multiplayer pictionary game made using flutter

Created an engaging Skribbl game application with Flutter, Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB for user data
 storage. MongoDB and Express were utilized for efficient data management, while Socket.IO enabled constant
 broadcasting of data between the server and client.
This allows players to create and join their private rooms using Socket. IO. Players take turns drawing a given word on a
 canvas while others guess it within a time limit, earning points based on their speed.
